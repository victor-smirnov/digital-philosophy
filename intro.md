# Philosophy of Memoria - Intro

Digital philosophy (DP) is not that "digital", after all, and not really a philosophy in the traditional meaning of this word. It's Algorithmic Information Theory together with some related disciplines (mostly, Psychology), applied to problems where it's not that easy to derive formal proofs or conduct reproducible experiments -- in the same [realm](/docs/misc/realm) Philosophy of Mind and Epistemology are typically operating in. DP does not currently have any new ideas. Many may claim that they "had been discussing this in Usenet conferences" ant it's most likely true. DP is a _compilation_ of existing ideas, with the central focus on the _Observer Problem_, a much more _practical_ reformulation of the Mind-Body problem from the philosophy of mind. 

DP is not an Academic Philosophy in the sense that:
1. It does not follow historical discourse in the Philosophy (of Mind) and, for that reason, is not that usable for polemics in the Academic context. 
2. It's based heavily in AIT and require nontrivial programming skills (for the reasons explained below), so "just use your mind" is not nearly enough. The "language of thoughts" does matter and the bar is really high.

DP is a _personal philosophy_ of an _Observer_ with the central question: _"What Am I?"_. And it's implied that the answer should be given in terms of algorithms and data structures which, according to AIT, are the ultimate form of any _language_ (modulo the "symbols grounding problem", of course). This is the reason why advanced theoretical and practical skills are necessary, because it's what Observer is using to describe itself. If this tool is too weak, adequate _self-models_ just can't be built. What is important is that weak Observer can't realize its inherent weaknesses.

Byproduct of DP's central question is conceptualization of _Theories of Mind_ (Psychological perspective) or _Self-Models_ (computational perspective). Observer's ability "to see", both inside and outside, is constituted by its self-model. According to AIT, a universal, complete, self-model is not finitely computable. And all feasible self-models will be so incomplete that it's _always the question_ if specific Observer $O$ can adequately understand predicate $P$. Everywhere, where there is an observer, there is also an additional free parameter -- its Theory of Mind:

> -- $P$ is true!
> -- Ok, but in which ToM?

When a sincere Moral Realist and Moral Relativist argue with each other about Ethics, they both are right inside their own ToMs, but they don't realize this difference. Not all ToMs allow implicit convergence without involving (more advanced) third parties. All epistemologies are observer-dependent. 

DP is based heavily in Academic Psychology but methodologically is not backward compatible with it. DP adopts and formalizes psychological language ("feeling is this state of a self-referential machine"), but both simplified setup and complex mathematics (AIT) does not yet allow using this language back in Psychology.

Memoria is meant to be a playground/gym where specific psychological traits can be developed in a systematic way _by solving real life problems_. Nevertheless, understanding DP is totally not required to _use_ Memoria, even for advanced uses, in the traditional meaning of this word for software frameworks. So, uninterested reader may safely skip this entire section of the documentation. 

The rest of this section is structured as follows. DP is currently more like a bunch of ideas rather than a structured framework. First, some necessary and relevant background from AIT, Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Mind is given. Next, we define Self-Referential Machine as a special class of algorithms and data structures as a rather rough but mathematically universal model of computable Observer. Finally, a few applications are given, together with relations to the Memoria project.
