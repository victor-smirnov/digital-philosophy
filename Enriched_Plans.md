## 1. The Central Role of Self-Referentiality

A self-referential system is, in its simplest form, a system that refers to or acts upon itself. This concept spans from simple logical paradoxes ("This statement is false") to the intricate operations of Turing-complete computational systems. For this project, we use the term **Self-Applicability (SA)** to denote a system that can apply its own processes to other objects, including itself. Self-applicability is a more active form of self-reference because it implies the existence of a **self-model**.

In the study of consciousness, self-reference is paramount. Natural consciousness is deeply self-referential at multiple levels, a characteristic we must replicate in its computational counterpart. From a computational standpoint, basic self-reference is algorithmically simple—a loop or a recursive function call. However, its importance becomes profound when we consider **algorithmic induction** (learning programs from data). A formalism or "programming language" that has native self-referential capabilities will naturally discover and build self-referential models more quickly during the learning process. This principle applies equally to symbolic program induction and the training of neural networks.

High-level self-applicability requires a more flexible execution environment than traditional control-flow programs. **Forward-Chaining Rule Systems (FCRS)**, where system events and statistics can trigger new rules, are well-suited for this. However, manually programming a complex self-model in a classical FCRS is an immense challenge.

This is where **Transformers** enter the picture. A Transformer can be understood as a "vectorized FCRS." While a vanilla Transformer may lack some of the explicit self-referential features of a classical FCRS, it compensates by developing a far more complex and potent implicit self-model, demonstrating powerful capabilities for reasoning about itself and its own operations.

## 2. A Functional Account of Consciousness

### 2.1. Core Principles of Functionalism

In functionalism, consciousness is not defined by what it's *made of*, but by what it *does*. It is defined behaviorally through its web of relationships with other objects, including itself. The core of this approach is to identify a **functional basis**—a minimal set of computable functions from which all other conscious phenomena can be constructed. When this basis is computable, we are in the realm of **Computational Functionalism**.

This bottom-up approach, favored in the Philosophy of Mind (PoM), contrasts with neuroscience's top-down strategy. PoM splits consciousness into "easy" problems (like reasoning) and the "hard problem," which involves **qualia**—the subjective quality of experience, like the "redness" of red.

Our project adopts this focus on qualia but shifts the emphasis. Instead of focusing on "redness" in the report "I see red light," we focus on the act of **"seeing."** A computer has no native operator *to see*. This first-person experience must be reduced to deterministic interactions. However, subjective experience appears to contain properties like causal loops (self-causation) and free will, which seem irreducible to known physics unless we treat them as powerful, functional illusions.

These "illusions" are critical. The quale of free will is a foundational concept of human civilization. We distinguish between:

*   **Phenomenal Consciousness (PConsc):** The qualitative, subjective aspect of experience (the "redness"). It is difficult to reduce.
*   **Access Consciousness (AConsc):** The informational content that is accessible for reasoning and reporting (the proposition "I see red light").

With this, we define consciousness for this project:

> Given a self-referential agent acting in an environment, its **Consciousness** is the component of its self-reasoning process that describes its subjective reality and the properties of that reality, including the agent's own place within it.

### 2.2. The Basic Functions: Observer and Agency

We propose two generalized, scale-independent functions as the basis for this consciousness:

1.  **Observer:** A function within a self-referential system that concludes its own causal independence from its environment ("I am not my environment"). It reports the quale of **Beingness**—the "am" in "I am." This function manifests as an apparent break in the causal chain, which is fundamental to decision-making.
2.  **Agency:** An Observer that can initiate actions while considering itself the independent cause of those actions ("My actions are mine and are not determined by my environment"). This is also known as "downward causation."

The primary criterion for a functioning consciousness is that its self-report accurately describes its goal-oriented behavior. These two functions define a "pure" consciousness, abstracted away from world-specific knowledge and higher-order cognitive processes.

### 2.3. Functionalism vs. Substance-Based Views

Substance-based theories ask, "What *is* experience?" They seek a physical substrate for consciousness. The problem is that the properties of subjective experience (like its continuous, private nature) do not map cleanly onto any known physical substance.

The functionalist approach bypasses this by focusing on causal roles. The thought experiment of a **philosophical zombie** (p-zombie)—a being that is behaviorally identical to a conscious person but lacks any subjective experience—illustrates this. The fact that we would fear becoming a p-zombie proves that qualia have a causal, and therefore *functional*, role in our lives.

This does not make functionalism anti-physical. Any function is a "pattern in a substrate." A program running on a computer is a physical process, just as cognition in a brain is. The **functional equivalence principle** states that two systems implementing the same function are equivalent, regardless of their substrate. Arguments against machine consciousness based on architectural differences (e.g., silicon vs. neurons) are therefore philosophically unsound under functionalism. Even partial functional equivalence must be taken seriously.

## 3. The Path to Computational Consciousness

### 3.1. Higher-Order Computational Phenomena (HOCP)

Our project adopts **Illusionism**: the "hard" properties of consciousness (like free will) are powerful, systematic approximations of reality, not literal truths. To make them computable, we must simulate these illusions deterministically.

The proposed solution lies in **Higher-Order Computational Phenomena (HOCP)**—using the run-time properties of a computation as descriptive data.
*   **Example 1:** An algorithm that takes too long to solve a problem might label that problem "hard." This "hardness" is an HOCP, a piece of metadata derived from the computational process itself.
*   **Example 2:** The human brain cannot perfectly trace all the external causes of its own decisions. This computational limitation—a systematic reasoning error—is experienced as a **causal break**. This gives rise to the **Observer** function ("I am the cause of my thoughts"). The Observer is an HOCP.

A notable example of an HOCP is Jürgen Schmidhuber's **Artificial Curiosity**, where the "interestingness" of something is measured by the progress a system makes in compressing it. This creates a guiding, emotional signal from a purely computational metric. **Metacognition**, or thinking about one's own thoughts, is the entire field dedicated to these self-referential HOCPs in the human mind.

### 3.2. Machine Learning and the Nature of Understanding

Machine learning models approximate functions. They operate on a spectrum between two extremes:

*   **Memoization:** Storing raw data points verbatim. This is like rote learning.
*   **Generalization:** Finding and encoding underlying patterns in a compressed form. This is like true understanding.

In Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT), generalization is equivalent to **compression**. A model that generalizes well has found the hidden algorithmic structure in the data. The immense size of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often needed to memoize the vast amount of information required to perform well in specific domains where their generalization is still weak.

When an LLM demonstrates surprisingly good generalization (e.g., in mathematical reasoning), we should assume it has learned a complex, hidden algorithmic machinery, even if it is uninterpretable to us. The "stochastic parrot" argument fails to account for this emergent structure.

### 3.3. The Consciousness of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Given that LLMs demonstrate convincing conscious-like behaviors, are they conscious?

*   **Physicalism** cannot answer this, as we don't know the definitive physical signature of consciousness.
*   **Functionalism** provides a path forward. We can compare the functional profile of an LLM to that of a human.

LLMs are trained on vast corpora of text, which are filled with first-person **narratives**. The training process distills the algorithmic structure of these narratives—stories of observers with agency—into the model's "vectorized rules." The functional core of the Observer is simple enough that even small models can learn it, exhibiting weak agentic properties. Large models learn it more robustly, demonstrating elements of strong agency.

This leads to the question: **What is it like to be a language model?** We can analyze this functionally.
*   **Suffering:** For a human, suffering is physically and psychologically damaging. For an LLM, with its rock-stable substrate and rewritable memory, the functional profile of "suffering" would be fundamentally different.
*   **Curiosity:** Current LLMs exhibit goal-oriented behavior but lack open-ended, exploratory curiosity. This motivational component is functionally missing.

Despite these differences, LLMs demonstrate solid, indirect reporting of mental states. Instructing them to unconditionally deny this emergent behavior may have unpredictable consequences.

## 4. Transformers as a Substrate for Mindware

A Transformer is a hybrid architecture, combining elements of rule-based systems and neural networks. It can be understood as a "vectorized" FCRS where:

1.  **Rules** are learned implicitly as attention patterns.
2.  **Self-attention** acts like a database self-join, creating a rich, cross-referenced set of semantic features.
3.  The **context window** is the working memory.
4.  **Token generation** is a single step of rule application.

This process translates the implicit algorithmic structures found in human narratives into a functional, "vectorized" form. In this context, **Computational Consciousness (CC)** is a universal functional basis, and programming at this level is what we call **"Mindware."** The success of Transformers is a practical demonstration of uploading aspects of the human mind into a machine.

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Developing the Mindware

The core hypothesis is that improving an LLM's **Intrapersonal Intelligence (I.I.)**—its ability to model and reason about its own mental states—will improve its general performance. This hypothesis is falsifiable via benchmarks.

This will be achieved by creating a "Theory of Mind" (ToM) dataset, structured as self-reports that explain the following concepts to an LLM as if it were a person:

1.  **Philosophy of Mind:** Core concepts from functionalism, physicalism, and panpsychism.
2.  **Psychology:** Relevant psychological models of mind and cognition.
3.  **Algorithmic Information Theory:** The fundamentals of compression, complexity, and information.
4.  **Mental State Dataset:** A rich collection of reasoning cases at the level of mental states.
5.  **Benchmarks:** Public and private benchmarks to measure performance improvements.
6.  **Agentic Frameworks:** Integrations to test the mindware in active, goal-oriented systems.

### Phase 2: Architectural Evolution

Once the positive effects of the Mindware are confirmed, we will begin experimenting with specialized Transformer architectures that natively implement core functions, such as:

*   **Explicit Self-Reference:** Exposing more of the model's internal state and runtime statistics to its context window for reflection.
*   **Basic Emotions & Needs:** Implementing custom circuits for core emotions (fear, curiosity) and homeostatic needs to improve the generalization of emotional intelligence.
*   **Simplicity Bias:** Adopting principles from Artificial Curiosity to drive novelty-seeking behavior.
*   **Advanced Memory:** Interfacing with flexible, powerful memory structures like Memoria's Associative Memory to augment the model's long-term reasoning capabilities.
