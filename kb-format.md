To structure your textual knowledge base for optimal LLM inference efficiency, focus on clarity, consistency, and atomicity. The goal is to make information easily retrievable and interpretable by the LLM, minimizing ambiguity and the need for complex reasoning during inference.

Here are detailed instructions:

### **1. Atomicity and Granularity: Break Down Information**

*   **Single Fact Per Statement:** Each line or short paragraph should ideally convey one distinct, atomic piece of information. Avoid combining multiple unrelated facts into a single sentence.
    *   **Bad:** "John is a software engineer who lives in New York and likes coffee." (Combines profession, location, and preference)
    *   **Good:**
        *   "John's profession is software engineer."
        *   "John lives in New York City."
        *   "John likes coffee."
*   **Small, Digestible Chunks:** Organize information into small, logically coherent blocks. This allows the LLM to retrieve only the most relevant sections without processing large, irrelevant texts.

### **2. Standardized Fact Representation: Be Explicit**

*   **Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) Structure:** Whenever possible, express facts in a clear subject-predicate-object (or entity-relationship-entity/attribute) format, even if using natural language. This mirrors how many knowledge graphs are structured and is highly interpretable by LLMs.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `[Subject] [is a type of] [Object]` (e.g., "Apple is a type of fruit.")
        *   `[Subject] [has property] [Value]` (e.g., "Apple's color is red.")
        *   `[Subject] [performs action] [Object]` (e.g., "John works at Google.")
*   **Use Consistent Naming and Terminology:**
    *   **Entities:** Always refer to the same entity (person, place, concept) using the exact same name or identifier throughout the knowledge base. Avoid aliases or variations unless explicitly defined.
        *   **Bad:** "NYC," "New York," "The Big Apple" for the same city.
        *   **Good:** Always "New York City."
    *   **Attributes/Properties:** Use consistent phrasing for attributes or relationships.
        *   **Bad:** "John's job," "John's occupation," "John works as."
        *   **Good:** Always "John's profession is..." or "John works as a..."
*   **Explicit Relationships:** Clearly state the nature of the relationship between entities or between an entity and its attribute. Use strong, unambiguous verbs.
    *   **Example:** "Paris is the capital of France." (Clear "is the capital of" relationship)
    *   **Example:** "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris." (Clear "is located in" relationship)

### **3. Enumeration and Categorization: Structure with Headings/Lists**

*   **Use Headings and Subheadings:** Organize your knowledge base with clear, descriptive headings (e.g., using Markdown `#`, `##`, `###`). This provides a hierarchical structure that LLMs can leverage for context and navigation.
    *   `# Entity: John Doe`
    *   `## Personal Information`
    *   `### Profession: Software Engineer`
    *   `### Location: New York City`
*   **Bulleted or Numbered Lists:** Use lists for enumerating related facts or properties. This visually breaks down information and signals to the LLM that items within the list are related.
    *   **Example:**
        *   `Key features of Product X:`
            *   `Feature 1: Real-time data processing.`
            *   `Feature 2: Cloud-agnostic deployment.`
            *   `Feature 3: Scalable architecture.`
*   **Consistent Indentation:** If using indentation to denote hierarchy or relationships, maintain it strictly.

### **4. Contextualization and Disambiguation: Provide Necessary Detail**

*   **Define Ambiguous Terms:** If a term could have multiple meanings, define it explicitly within the knowledge base or ensure its context always clarifies its intended meaning.
*   **Specify Scope/Applicability:** If a fact is only true under certain conditions or within a specific context, state those conditions clearly.
    *   **Example:** "The speed limit is 60 mph *on highways*."
*   **Avoid Pronouns Without Clear Antecedents:** While natural language uses pronouns, in a knowledge base, excessive use without clear, immediate antecedents can confuse the LLM. Rephrase for clarity if necessary.
    *   **Bad:** "John went to the store. He bought apples. They were red." (Ambiguous "They")
    *   **Good:** "John went to the store. John bought apples. The apples were red."

### **5. Metadata and Tagging (Implicit in Text): Aid Retrieval**

*   **Keywords/Tags within Text:** While not explicit "tags" in a database sense, strategically include relevant keywords and phrases within your factual statements. This improves the likelihood of the LLM retrieving the correct information based on a user's query.
    *   If a document is about "Project Alpha," ensure "Project Alpha" is mentioned frequently and clearly.
*   **Categorical Statements:** Include statements that categorize entities.
    *   "Product X is a software application."
    *   "New York City is a major metropolitan area."

### **6. Natural Language Clarity and Simplicity: Avoid Complexity**

*   **Simple Sentence Structures:** Prefer simple, declarative sentences over complex, compound, or convoluted ones.
*   **Direct Language:** Avoid jargon, idioms, metaphors, or highly subjective language unless they are explicitly defined within the knowledge base.
*   **Active Voice:** Generally, active voice is clearer and more direct than passive voice.
    *   **Bad:** "The report was written by Sarah."
    *   **Good:** "Sarah wrote the report."
*   **No Redundancy (Unless for Emphasis/Clarity):** Avoid repeating the exact same fact multiple times unless it serves a specific purpose (e.g., reinforcing a critical piece of information in different contexts).

### **Example of a Well-Structured Entry:**

```
